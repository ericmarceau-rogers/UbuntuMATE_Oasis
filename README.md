# UbuntuMATE_Oasis
A collection of documents which are offered as templates to document a user's personal Desktop installation of a Linux distribution.  There may be included scripts to probe the installed configuration before, or automate the process of customization after, the fresh installation of a new distribution image.

The "Customization__PostInstall_Ubuntu_18.04.ods" file is a spreadsheet template tool to help document what needs to be done, plan the sequence, and highlight what is required before/after each documented step.
