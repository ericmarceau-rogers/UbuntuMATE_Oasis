# UbuntuMATE_Oasis
A collection of documents which are offered as templates to document a user's personal Desktop installation of a Linux distribution.  There may be included scripts to probe the installed configuration before, or automate the process of customization after, the fresh installation of a new distribution image.

**Customization__PostInstall_Ubuntu_18.04.ods**

This file is a spreadsheet template tool to help document what needs to be done, plan the sequence, and highlight what is required before/after each documented step.

**Distro__InstallationSequenceAndCustomization_2.3.odt**

This file is my attempt at trying to fully document, in a single document, the sequence of steps that need to be followed for an UbuntuMATE fresh install.  It is a bit dated (meant for UM 20.04), I haven't had time to revisit since my install of 20.04 or my recent 22.04 install.

My intent here is to make it available to see if others can reap benefit of the structured sequencing that is documented, as well as make people reflect on choices made at various critical junctures in the installation/customization process.

The other documents are each my attempt at "Topic-Focused Customization" or "Component-Focused Customization" documentation, such that, when ALL is lost, these provide the fallback as the Rosetta stone to reconstruct what was previously created for the Personal Desktop installation.
